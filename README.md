# Weather App

A weather app that allows the user to search for the weather in cities around the UK. There are small summaries of the day and the following four days showing the date, an icon of the weather, maximum temperature, and a small description. Beneath these summaries is a more detailed summary of the day with maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. The user can click on more details to see the detailed summary of each day listed.

## Motivation

This app was built as part of my coursework at Manchester Codes. I practiced using React, useState, and useEffect.
